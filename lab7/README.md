I have a boat on the left just kinda chillin, a shark circling on the right, and a beach ball on the land, with 3 different palm trees on the 
island. For the waves I used 3D sin waves based on how far each point on the place was to the given center. This made a really cool effect that I had to cool down a lot. I posted a gif in the Discord banter channel (you should check it out). Honestly that part was the most challenging, but also the coolest to me. I know it's not as detailed, but I was more invested in makin the cool water effect rather than the OBJ imports.



Which part did they do?
   My partner did the Unity part of the project!
Which part of a tutorial did your partner find most challenging?
	my most challenging part was to make the mountain plane looks nice. At first it only folds in one axis. What I did to solve this is to split the position of distorted UVs and re-combine that the distortion is based on x and z axies instead of x and y axies.
Which part of a tutorial did your partner find most interesting?
	The most interesting part is when I was looking around my mountain plane, I found one direction with the best reflection of the directional/sun light. I changed the direction of the light to make my cemara see that effect.
