I have a boat on the left just kinda chillin, a shark circling on the right, and a beach ball on the land, with 3 different palm trees on the 
island. For the waves I used 3D sin waves based on how far each point on the place was to the given center. This made a really cool effect that I had to cool down a lot. I posted a gif in the Discord banter channel (you should check it out). Honestly that part was the most challenging, but also the coolest to me. I know it's not as detailed, but I was more invested in makin the cool water effect rather than the OBJ imports.
