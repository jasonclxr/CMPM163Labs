The cube on the far left I used by having the shader use the unique X, Y, Z positions to create a color. The rotating cube I used a MeshToonMaterial with a 0.5 shininess and a gray emissive.
The center cube is what was provided. The cube on the right uses the white to greenish shader technique that was provided in the code.
