The cube on the far left I used by having the shader go between a very playful purple and a bright red. The rotating cube I used a MeshToonMaterial with a 0.5 shininess and a gray emissive.
The center cube is what was provided. The cube on the right uses the white to greenish shader technique that was provided in the code.
