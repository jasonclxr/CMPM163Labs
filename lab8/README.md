Here's the picture for my inspiration:

I tried to have a centered city in my perlin generated plane. I had it so that the town would generate higher and higher
from a given vector, and the closer you were the lower the area was which is why you get a blank field of water and grass.
I textured everything so that each building would be colored to it's height, and if low enough, just flattened.

I talked to my partner Finnegan and he said that his inspiration was the settlers of CATAN which is a pretty fun game. They 
didn't teach me anything, and wasn't finished by the time I submitted, but I do know they did part1 on Unity.
